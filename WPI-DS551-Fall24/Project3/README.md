## Leaderboard and Bonus Points
In this project, we will provide a leaderboard and give **10** bonus points to the **top 3** highest reward students! 
* Where to see the leaderboard 
  * We will create a discussion on Canvas and each of you can post your highest reward with a sreenshot. TA will summarize your posts and list the top 3 highest rewards and post it below. <br>
  * The leaderboards of previous years are also posted at the end of this page, you can check it out.

* How to elvaluate
  * You should submit your lastest trained model and python code. TA will run your code to make sure the result is consistent with your screenshot. 
* How to grade
  * Top 3 students on the leaderboard can get 10 bonus points for project 3.
  
## Setup
* Recommended programming IDE (integrated development environment): VS code (See [install VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) 
* Install [Miniconda](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Create virtual environment and install Python 3: conda create -n myenv python=3.11.4. This will help you create a new conda environment named myenv. Gymnasium library supports for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 on Linux and macOS.
* Activate your virtual environment: `conda activate myenv`
* Install gymnasium: `pip install opencv-python-headless gymnasium[atari] autorom[accept-rom-license]` (See [install gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium))
* install pytorch: See [install pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
* For the  Atari wrapper, install the following two items: `pip install -U "ray[rllib]" ipywidgets`
* For successfully running code, you may also need to install the following item: `pip install --upgrade scipy numpy`.
* For video recording in testing, install the following three items: `pip install moviepy`, `pip install ffmpeg`.
* When testing, for nice output on the terminal, you need to install tqdm: `pip install tqdm`

## How to run :
training DQN:
* `$ python main.py --train_dqn`

testing DQN:
* `$ python main.py --test_dqn`

testing DQN while recording a video (recording video takes time, so usually you use this option when the number of testing episodes is small):
* `$ python main.py --test_dqn --record_video`

## Goal
In this project, you will be asked to implement DQN to play [Breakout](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/breakout/). This project will be completed in Python 3 using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). The goal of your training is to get averaging reward in 100 episodes over **40 points** in **Breakout** (each episode has 5 lives), with OpenAI's Atari wrapper & clipped reward. For more details, please see the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Yg1_RIOF7LA_a6uSa0lZ4asmayQ1s6ce/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106040042903845857494&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Deliverables
Please compress all the below files into a zipped file and submit the zip file (firstName_lastName_hw3.zip) to Canvas.

* **Trained Model**
  * Model file (.pth)
  * If your model is too large for Canvas, upload it to a cloud space and provide the download link 

* **PDF Report**
  * screenshot of the test results
  * Set of Experiments Performed: 
    * Include a section describing the set of experiments that you performed
    * what structures you experimented with (i.e., number of layers, number of neurons in each layer)
    * what hyperparameters you varied (e.g., number of epochs of training, batch size and any other parameter values, weight initialization schema, activation function)
    * what kind of loss function you used and what kind of optimizer you used.
  * Special skills: Include the skills which can improve the generation quality. Here are some [tips](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298.pdf) may help. (Optional)
  * Visualization: Learning curve of DQN. 
    * X-axis: number of episodes
    * Y-axis: average reward in last 30 episodes.
    
    <img src="/Project3/materials/plot.png" width="60%" >

* **Python Code**
  * All the code you implemented including sample codes.

## Grading
* **Trained Model (50 points)**
  * Getting averaging reward in 100 episodes over **40 points** (with 5 lives) in Breakout will get full credits. 
  * For every average reward below 40, you will be taken off 2 points. i.e., you will be taken off 2 points, if getting averaging reward in 100 episodes is 39 and taken off 4 points, if averaging reward is 38, so on so forth.

* **PDF Report (30 points)**
  * Set of parameters performed: 20 points
  * Visualization: 10 points
  
* **Python Code (20 points)**
  * You can get full credits if the scripts can run successfully, otherwise you may loss some points based on your error.
